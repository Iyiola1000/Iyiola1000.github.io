What is Jacascript?
JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. Features like:

    animated graphics
    photo slideshows
    autocomplete text suggestions
    interactive forms
In my COMP 484 class (Web Engineering) we are learning about Javascript to incorporate it to our websites to explore all the usues of it first hand.
