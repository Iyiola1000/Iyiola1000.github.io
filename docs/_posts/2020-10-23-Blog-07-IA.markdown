In my CIT 480 class we are working with ansible for automation.
What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. 
Before we get started we have to install ansible on our Ubuntu system and to that i ran the following code in terminal
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install ansible

Ansible Playbook
playbooks are more useful for multiple tasks. Playbooks are text files written in the YAML format. An example of what one would look like is 
"
---
- hosts: all
tasks:
- name: list files in folder
command: ls
