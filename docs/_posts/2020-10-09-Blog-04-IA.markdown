What is cryptography?
Currenttly in my Comp 424 class we are working with decrypting codes, we were allowed to use any method of our choosing so i decided to use a language called julia to complete this task and aslo had to use dictionary libraires to find the most likely word.
Modern cryptography concerns itself with the following four objectives:

    Confidentiality: the information cannot be understood by anyone for whom it was unintended
    Integrity: the information cannot be altered in storage or transit between sender and intended receiver without the alteration being detected
    Non-repudiation: the creator/sender of the information cannot deny at a later stage his or her intentions in the creation or transmission of the information
    Authentication: the sender and receiver can confirm each other's identity and the origin/destination of the information
